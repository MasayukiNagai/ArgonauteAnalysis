# ESM2_MSA_Comparison

## Format
1. `msa_pos`: position in the MSA
2. `pos`: position in the original AA sequence
3. `AA`: AA or a gap in the MSA
4. `esm2_AA`: AA that has the highest conservation score out of 20 AAs according to ESM2[1]. Only relevant when the conservation score is high enough.
5. `conservation_score`: Conservation score (probability) computed by ESM2 using categorical jacobian[2] 
6. `count`: The number of samples that have the same AA as `AA` (of the target) at the MSA position. Can be used to see how unique the AA is. The minimum is 1 (i.e., only the target sequence has the AA at the positin) and the maximum is the number of samples (i.e., all the samples have the AA at the position = highly conserved across the samples). 
7. column 7 or after have an AA or a gap in the MSA for each sample


## Data 
For the data stored here, 

- FASTA: 40 Argonaute sequences (18 AGO, 7 PIWI, 15 WAGO)
- MSA: generated by the following command
```
clustalo -i Argonaute.fasta -o Argonaute.msa.fasta  --outfmt=fasta --auto -v
```
- ESM2 conservation score: generated by the `compute conservation` in [this colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabBio/blob/main/categorical_jacobian/esm2.ipynb)
    - Conservation maps were generated for 14/40 sequences so far
